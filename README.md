<h1 align="center">efetch</h1>
<p align="center">is a system information tool written in C++</p><br>

``efetch`` was written by me to learn more about the C/C++ programming language, currently support for multiple operating systems is lacking, however it is pretty easy to add more operating systems. If you wish, you can open a [PR](https://github.com/NoSequel/efetch/pulls) to add more support and/or clean up code.

## OS Support
Currently we support 2 OS' (1 untested).
* Linux:
    - Gentoo/Linux (Portage)
* BSD:
    - FreeBSD/BSD (pkg)

## Configuration
It is possible to edit the primary colors inside of the ``main.c`` file (``primary`` and ``secondary`` colors).

## Installation
  - You are able to run the ``compile.sh`` script in order to update and/or install ``efetch``
